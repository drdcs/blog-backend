For database authentication,  we need to establish two entities.
* users
* roles
<p>
The relationship between the users and the roles entities would be many to many.
So, we need to introduce a table called user_roles , which keeps the user_id and role_id.
<h4>branch: git checkout database_authentication
</h4>
